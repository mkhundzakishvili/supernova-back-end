### To run the server you need to:

- Have a db(in this case i have already uploaded a small db. username: Mariami, password: 123123KK)

  To create a db call function called **createUsersTable()** only once;


- Install node modules


```bash
npm install
```

- To start the server run command
```bash
npm run dev
```



### To create/register user:

You need to open graphql server interface and run **createUser** query.
